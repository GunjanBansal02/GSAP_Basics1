![GSAP Demo](./gsap-demo.png)

This is a small practice project where I explored the basics of **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** â€” a robust JavaScript library for high-performance animations.

## ðŸ’¡ What is GSAP?

**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** is a JavaScript library used for creating high-performance, smooth, and complex animations on the web. It allows you to animate HTML elements, SVGs, canvas objects, and more with precision and control.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features of GSAP:
- Timeline-based sequencing of animations
- Chaining and staggering of multiple animations
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Works seamlessly with vanilla JS, React, and other frameworks

## ðŸ§ª What This Project Demonstrates

In this project, I experimented with:

- **Basic element animations** using `gsap.to()` and `gsap.from()`
- **GSAP Timelines** for sequencing multiple animations together
- Smooth transitions, delays, easing, and coordination of animations
